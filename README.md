# PriceCalculator

PriceCalculator is a simple web utility I created in order to make easier to
evaluate the price for my freelancer work.

## Usage

It takes 3 inputs
<<<<<<< HEAD

- hours -> amount of hours you think your task is gonna take.
- minutes -> amount of minutes you think your task is gonna take
=======
- hours          -> amount of hours you think your task is gonna take.
- minutes        -> amount of minutes you think your task is gonna take
>>>>>>> 8b547da3ba6e4637e1f0a7ef26617e72557fd7e4
- Euros per hour -> amount of euros you want to earn for each working hour

Once you modify one of those 3 you'll see the amount of money you want to ask.
